    <p>Today there are more than 2000 programming languages
     and their number is increasing every year. 
     Some languages are popular, others are used only by authors.
     It is even possible to use several programming languages
     simultaneously to create professional programs. The great diversity of programming languages
     makes it impossible to classify them according to any single scale.
     There is no best programming language, just as there is no best normal spoken language.
     The choice of programming language should be determined by its intended use.</p>
